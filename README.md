# b2-sync

*disclaimer* --
This project is still in a very partial state. There really isn't any fully functional part of it at this point. It works for the most part, but it's by no means complete or without issue.

## What is this
In short, it's a generic sync script to take any number of directories and upload everything in them to [backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/) [b2 storage](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) buckets.

## How to use
In short, just copy config-dist.ini to config.ini and update it with your stuff. Build and run it. You should start seeing things upload.
